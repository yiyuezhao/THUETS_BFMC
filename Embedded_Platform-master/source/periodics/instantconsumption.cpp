    * @brief Measures and filters the instantaneous current consumption, updating global tracking variables.
    * 
    * This function reads an analog input value representing current consumption, scales it to milliamps, and stores it in a circular buffer.
    * A moving average of the last `windowSize` readings is computed to smooth out short-term fluctuations. Additionally, an Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    * is updated to provide a weighted average of the current consumption over time. The total consumption and elapsed time are accumulated for further processing.
    *
    * The function is called periodically according to the task period (in milliseconds). It calculates both the raw instantaneous current and the smoothed
    * values (via moving average and EMA), which can be used for safety measures or consumption monitoring.
    * 
    * @param task_period The interval (in milliseconds) between each call to the function, used to accumulate total elapsed time.
    * 
    * Global Variables:
    * - `uint32_globalsV_instant_mAmpsH`: Stores the most recent instantaneous current value, scaled in milliamps.
    * - `uint32_globalsV_consumption_Total_mAmpsH`: Accumulates the total current consumption in milliamps over time.
    * - `uint32_globalsV_numberOfMiliseconds_Total`: Accumulates the total time passed (in milliseconds) for consumption calculations.
    * 
    * Steps:
    * 1. Read the current sensor (pin_value) and scale the result to milliamps.
    * 2. Store the current value in a circular buffer (size = `windowSize`).
    * 3. Calculate the moving average (mean) over the last `windowSize` readings.
    * 4. Update the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to smooth fluctuations over time.
    * 5. Accumulate total current consumption and elapsed time for further analysis.

    * @brief Periodically computes and sends the exponentially smoothed instantaneous consumption value over the serial connection.
    * 
    * When this function is active, it calculates the consumption value based on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the instantaneous current readings.
    * The EMA is multiplied by the configured period (`m_period`) to scale the value to the desired time frame (milliseconds).
    * 
    * The result is then formatted and sent over a serial connection in a specific string format. The transmitted value represents the 
    * smoothed instantaneous consumption rate in milliamp-hours (mAh), converted from the EMA and task period.
    * 
    * Key Steps:
    * 1. Check if the component is active (`m_isActive`). If not, the function returns without performing any operations.
    * 2. Compute the scaled consumption value by multiplying the current Exponential Moving Average (`currentEMA`) by the period (`m_period`).
    * 3. Format the calculated value in milliamp-hours (mAh) as a string and send it over the serial connection.
    * 
    * @note This function is part of a periodic task and does not include any direct measurement or scaling from the A2 pin. It relies on the previously 
    *       updated `currentEMA` to smooth short-term fluctuations in consumption readings.
