Traffic lights
--------------

The traffic lights are similar to the real traffic lights with three colors: red, yellow and green. 
It's 24 cm heigh and the lights are 4.5cm diameter. 

There will be five semaphores on the race track. One placed at the starting point, and for placed in 
the traffic light intersection. Besides showing the appropriate color, they will 
also broadcast their state via Wi-Fi UDP messages (described in the V2X section). You can find the 
link to the traffic light here: `traffic light <https://www.amazon.com/TOYANDONA-Multicoloured-Simulation-Crosswalk-Education/dp/B08SM96CHK/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=traffic+light+toy&qid=1665752048&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiNS4xNiIsInFzcCI6IjQuNjQifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-5>`_.

Pedestrian
----------

On the race track there will be a human-like pedestrian doll waiting to pass at one of the crosswalks 
during the run and one crossing on an unsigned space on the map (if the team choses to have it)

You can find the official link to the store here: `pedestrian doll <https://www.amazon.co.uk/Simba-EVI-Love-First-Bike/dp/B000UTKNI0>`_.

Obstacle vehicles
-----------------

The obstacle vehicles are cars (similar to the car each team got) with different casings. The cars can either be
static, they won't move and they will be simulating a broken car; or dynamic, so they will be moving around the track.



Highway separator
-----------------

A series of `Separator blocks <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/Separator_block.STL>`_
wil be placed on the highway, on the line which is dividing the driving ways.

Ramp
----

A `ramp <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/ramp.STL>`_ placed right before the highway. 

The ramp is covered with the same material as the rest of the track, it's dimensions can be seen in the picture below:

Tunnel
------

A `tunnel <https://github.com/ECC-BFMC/Documentation/blob/master/source/3DModels/TrackParts/Tunnel.STL>`_ placed on the speed curve.
