Start developing on raspberry
=============================

Install the image on the SD card
--------------------------------
Download the Raspberry Pi OS (Desktop or Lite version) from `this <https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/>`_ link. 

Mount the chosen image on your RPi with the help of `BalenaEtcher <https://www.balena.io/etcher/>`_.

Another alternative is to use the `Raspberry Pi Imager <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_. From this tool you can easily 
flash any available os for raspberry pi and set up various things, such as network setup and ssh communication.

Setting up WLAN
---------------
Without directly connecting to the RPi, you can set the LAN from the PC by creating a wpa_supplicant.conf file under boot folder, on your SD card.
You can set the content as follows (only valid for Raspbian OS, for Ubuntu os there's a different process):

.. code-block:: bash

    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    update_config=1
    country=RO
    network=
    {
        ssid="SSID"
        psk="Passwd"
    }

You can also edit the file later on. it can be found also on the os after connecting to it, under /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf.

Configuring your Raspberry Pi
-----------------------------
There is a series of configuration parameters that can be edited on the PC, prior to starting 
the RPI. Some of these are stored in the **config.txt** document, found in the /boot/ folder. 
By editing this document one could, for example, adjust the way the display is detected and 
the desktop displayed, or overclock the Raspberry Pi (or return to default clock settings). 
A useful setting is the enabling of the Serial Console so that the Raspberry Piâ€™s terminal can
be accessed using a serial connection. The file can be also visually edited by using the raspi-config 
application while accessing the RPi. 

Editing the **config.txt** file:

    - https://elinux.org/R-Pi_configuration_file

Some more configurations can be done prior to starting the RPi, such as enabling SSH connection, 
Camera connection or I2C connection. In order to do so, you just have to create an empty file with the 
name of the interface, without an extension, under /boot/ folder. The same parameters can also be edited
with the raspi-config application while accessing the RPi.

Raspberry Pi IP address
-----------------------
For most of the applications, the IP of the RPi is crucial. After you set up the network for your RPi and 
power it up, you can find the address with different means, such as: using a network scan tool on your PC 
(nmap for linux); connecting to your router and finding your connected devices; ping your device by using 
it's username: 

.. code-block:: bash

    ping raspberrypi.local

    PING raspberrypi.local (192.168.1.131): 56 data bytes
    64 bytes from 192.168.1.131: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=2.618 ms

Development on the Raspberry Pi 
--------------------------------

You have multiple ways of accessing the RPi: 
- Direct development approach, by using it as a standalone computer and connecting all the peripherals.
- Direct connection approach, by connecting to it with a Serial cable or with an ethernet cable.
- Remote connection approach, by connecting to it via ssh terminal communication and ftp for file transfer to the remote.

Direct development approach	
````````````````````````````
You can connect all the peripherals and develop on it as you would do on a PC. The suggested OS is the desktop version. 
Follow `this guide <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up>`_ for more info:


Direct connection approach. 	
---------------------------
This option for connecting to your Raspberry Pi in physical format can be done in may ways, but the most 
handful ones are with a TTL cable or with an Ethernet cable. By using the `serial <https://www.ftdichip.com/Products/Cables/USBTTLSerial.htm>`_ 
cable you can connect to your system for performing initial setup, such as WLAN SSID and password. You 
should have the Serial Console enabled for being able to connect to the Raspberry Pi in this way. This 
can be done easily by editing the config.txt file of the system. Another way in doing so is by setting 
up a LAN between the RPi and the PC, connecting them via ethernet and accessing it via ssh. Below you 
can find some useful resources that describe the steps required for connecting to the terminal in this way.

    - `Serial cable <https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/headless-raspberry-pi-setup/serial-terminal>`_ 
    - `Ethernet cable <https://www.instructables.com/Set-Up-Raspberry-Pi-4-Through-Laptoppc-Using-Ether/>`_ 

Remote Connection approach - SSH and SFTP
-----------------------------------------
The best combination in programming your RPi remotely is a combination between a ssh connection for 
terminal commands and a SFTP connection for file sharing (this way, the OS installed can be the lite version). 
On linux the SSH connection can be done in any terminal (ssh user@IP) and the SFTP connection in any file 
explorer (other locations->Connect to Server: sftp://ip). On windows, the `PUTTY <https://tutorials-raspberrypi.com/raspberry-pi-remote-access-by-using-ssh-and-putty/>`_ 
application can be used for ssh connection and the `WINSCP <https://www.behind-the-scenes.co.za/using-winscp-to-connect-to-a-raspberry-pi>`_  
can be used for file sharing. 

Remote Connection approach - VNC
-----------------------------------------
`VNC <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc>`_ is a graphical desktop sharing system that allows 
you to remotely control the desktop interface of one computer. Running VNC Server, in our case Raspberry Pi, you can 
connect to it from another computer or mobile device (running VNC Viewer). The tutorial below describes how work on 
it from another device by remote control.
