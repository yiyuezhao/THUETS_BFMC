Python
------
Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. It is versatile, easy to use and fast 
to develop, which makes it ideal for rapid prototyping. Some of it's downsides is that it has speed limitation, 
it does not perform well with multithreading, making it inferior in performances to other, low-level programming languages.
The links below represent a good starting point for this type of applications.

CPP
---
It is one of the oldest, most used and most efficient programming languages. It has a wide support, it is powerful, 
fast and has a small amount of standard libraries. It's major downside being it's complexity.
